Currently, he is a post-doctoral fellow at Northwestern University where he is using state-of-the-art proteomics technology and live-cell imaging of reporter systems to understand the molecular networks governing promoter activity of Cytomegalovirus. In addition to his research, Dr. Savaryn has a passion for education and is excited to be teaching for the NU School of Continuing Studies.",
