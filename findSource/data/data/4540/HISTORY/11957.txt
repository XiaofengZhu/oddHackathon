He specializes in South Asian intellectual history, particularly in early modern north India. His research draws on several linguistic traditions (including Persian, Hindi-Urdu, and Sanskrit), and speaks to a number of related themes: literary and political culture; modes of cultural translation and religious dialogue; memory and historiography; literary periodization and canonicity; Orientalist constructions of the past; and the South Asian and European imperial imaginations, from antiquity to the present.",
