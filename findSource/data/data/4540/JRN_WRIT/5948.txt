Major feature assignments will be returned with editing comments, and will be rewritten at the instructor's discretion. These will be weighted to comprise 30% of the final course grade..\n\nDEADLINES\nOther than two major feature pieces, most assignments will be completed in class, or are due during the following class. Exceptions will be noted and explained in advance. \n\nMagazine articles don't get published if they're not on time. You're expected to turn assignments when they are due. Late articles will not be accepted unless an extension is O.K.'d prior to the deadline. Students must develop the \"whatever it takes to get it done\" attitude essential for successful writers working on multiple projects and tight deadlines."

Since each class dovetails into the next, with assignments requiring significant time for proper results, missed classes can hurt. Please make sure you arrange to cover any missed assignments or class work. Coverage means making arrangements with a fellow student to obtain missed assignments, and contacting the instructor in advance of the missed class."

Magazine articles must begin with a crisp, compelling, unique, interesting idea. The first phase of the course is to uncover and develop the skills necessary to turn topics and subjects into great story concepts.\n\n2. Development: Once an idea has crystallized, it needs substance. This includes background, research, interviews and the other aspects of investigation that create depth and credibility.\n\n3. Writing: With a winning idea and sufficient resources in place, writing completes the process. And if the first two phases are done well, writing is a lot easier. The course will examine a variety of writing conventions, techniques, styles and devices that add color, depth and personality."
