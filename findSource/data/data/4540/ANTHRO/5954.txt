        "bio": "My research and teaching focus primarily on the ways in which human social behavior and culture are shaped by biological evolution.  Most of the courses I teach focus heavily on this topic.  Critics of this kind of use of evolutionary theory often suggest that applying evolutionary theory to the study of human behavior discourages altruistic and moral behavior.  This has led me to look into and write about the evolutionary foundations of morality and of religion.  I am convinced that a well-informed appreciation of the biological foundations of morality can enhance our ability to deal with moral issues.  I have been teaching anthropology for over 40 years, and, in the 1960s and 1970s, I did field research among the Turkmen of northern Iran.  In the 1960s and the 1970s, I made three trips to Iran and spend a total of 44 months living in that country.",

This will include an understanding of kin selection, sexual and social selection, the evolution of elaborate sociality in the human descent line, and the development of language and culture as means of achieving elaborate social cooperation.  Students should also have an appreciation of the naturalistic fallacy and the broader question of the social and political implications of evolutionary research."
