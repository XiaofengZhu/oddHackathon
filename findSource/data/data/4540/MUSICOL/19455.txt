Graduate students have the option of undertaking a research project on a Lied-related topic approved by the instructor (25%) in lieu of taking the final examination.  Those students opting for the project must obtain the instructor's approval of the research topic by the time of the midterm and must submit their research paper by the same day that their classmates take the final examination. 10% of the grade will be based on class participation, naturally including attendance (mandatory),  but also including informed participation in class discussion."
