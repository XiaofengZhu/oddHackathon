        "bio": "Ben Gorvine is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Psychology at Northwestern, where he is also currently serving as the assistant chair. He received his Ph.D. in Psychology from the University of Michigan in 2002.  His dissertation work centered on understanding the influences, both positive and negative, that fathers and father figures (i.e., men other than the biological father who may be fulfilling the fathering role) had on their children's socioemotional development, and he continues to have an interest in working with young men around issues of masculinity and parenting.  He worked for a number of years as an affiliate psychotherapist at the Family Institute at Northwestern University, where he saw adults, children, couples, and families. In what used to be his spare time, he is kept happily occupied by his two daughters, Emma (age 14) and Sophie (age 8).",
