If you have not taken Spanish 101-A in the fall quarter, you must contact the instructor before registering in the course to determine if 101-B is the right level for you. It is crucial that only beginners register in this course since having students with higher language levels in the classroom would be detrimental to those students who are correctly placed in this level. Only students who have never taken Spanish before should enroll in this course. \n\nPlease email the instructor if you need further guidance or if you have any other questions regarding placement."
