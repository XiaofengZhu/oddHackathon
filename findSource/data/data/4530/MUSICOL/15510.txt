    "overview": "<em>Music and the Visual Arts</em><p>This course will consider some of the many ways in which the senses of sight and hearing interact in western images and music-making, in select musical works inspired by concurrent ideas or movements in the visual arts, and in some of the many broader forms of multi-media and performance art. We will concentrate primarily on thematically-linked works from the 1600s to the present.  Each student will have ample opportunity to pursue personal interests, and to share information and ideas with the class.</p>",
