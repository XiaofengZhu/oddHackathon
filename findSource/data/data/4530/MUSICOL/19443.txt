    "overview": "<em>Europop</em> <p>Discover French chanteurs and chanteuses, among them the American/French \"Black Pearl\" Josephine Baker.  Move with Italian disco; \"with a little help from friends\" join the British invasion of the 1960s; feel the patriotic mass vibe of Soviet songs and post-Soviet riots, embraced or imprisoned; learn the voices of today's rebellions, violence, and war.  And afterwards, in the second half of the class, enjoy the media glitz and political gambling of the Eurovision song contest - a major institution of Western popular entertainment, competition, diplomacy, and commercialism. </p>",
