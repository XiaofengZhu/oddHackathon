    "overview": "<em>Bel Canto Opera</em> <p>This course is designed to provide a window on the world of early 19th-century Italian opera: composers, librettists, singers, impresarios, performance practice, and generic and stylistic conventions.  Representative operas by the three outstanding composers of the period (Gioachino Rossini, Gaetano Donizetti, and Vincenzo Bellini) will be studied from different angles, reinforced through a variety of reading, listening, and viewing assignments.  \"Minor\" composers such as Giovanni Pacini and Saverio Mercadante will also be considered, and perhaps reevaluated.</p><p>The aim overall is to make possible a critical examination of the term \"Bel Canto\" (\"beautiful singing\") by which this repertoire is often designated, with its implicit suggestion that these operas are primarily conceived as demonstrations of vocal beauty and ability.</p> <p>A knowledge of Italian will be helpful but not essential.</p>",
