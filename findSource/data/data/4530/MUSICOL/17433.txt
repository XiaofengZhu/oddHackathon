    "overview": "<em>Graduate Review of Music History</em> <p>This course will review the history of western art music with an overall aim of providing useful skills for the graduate careers and working lives of professional musicians. Beyond the goal of identifying and addressing students' areas of weakness in preparation for music-history comprehensive exams, our special focus will be the acquisition of pedagogy skills for the college-level teaching of music history, and most of the quarter's assignments (teaching demos, sample syllabi, etc.) will be designed to enhance students' experience in this area.</p>",
