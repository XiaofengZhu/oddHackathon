    "overview": "<em>Passions and Devotional Music</em> <p>This course focuses on how Western European and American \"art\" musics of the seventeenth century function as rhetorical discourse: in other words, how \"baroque\" musical thought and composition communicate texts dramatically and persuasively.</p> <p>This quarter, special emphasis will be directed toward rhetoric in polyphonic settings of the biblical Passions, from both the Catholic and Protestant traditions, in a long seventeenth century that extends from the Council of Trent to J. S. Bach, as well as to other genres of devotional music such as chorales and villancicos</p> <p>Specific class discussion and individual research into Passions repertoires - which coincides with and complements B.C.E. performance selections - will be situated within a broader context of styles and issues in seventeenth-century choral music, including study of Monteverdi, Schtz, and Spanish composers.</p><p>Students will tackle articles from scholarly journals, primary sources, debate the concept of \"baroque\" within the frame of cultural studies, and engage the uses of choral music in a period of religious renewal and strife. In so doing, they will gain working knowledge of the period as a whole as well as a specific and understudied repertoire.</p>",
