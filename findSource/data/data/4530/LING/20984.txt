The symbolic role that a dictionary and the book-form have in defining, shaping, and influencing a society, which includes not only what language and whose language is included (e.g. does ain't belong in the dictionary and with what type of definition), but also how can the physical form of a dictionary contribute to its role and power (for example, whether print-book or digital form).\n3) Whether the digital medium changes the way we think, use, feel, design, and create dictionaries, and what effects does this perhaps have on the conventional standards of the prestige, authority, and power wielded by the traditional editorial-board-driven print-book dictionaries? \n4) An understanding of the fields of lexicography and sociolinguistic fieldwork.\n5) A working understanding of designing and creating an online e-dictionary."
