Abdi Rafiee's Colloquial Persian will form the basis for the lectures on grammar and most of the exercises. L.P.Elwell-Sutton's Elementary Persian Grammar will also be used for presenting the alphabet and some further grammar points. Reading selections, workbook pages, and films on various topics are also drawn from other sources. Samples of classical Persian literature are brought in for cultural enrichment, but contemporary Persian writing (newspapers, literature) is also included. Classes will meet for 3 hours weekly."
