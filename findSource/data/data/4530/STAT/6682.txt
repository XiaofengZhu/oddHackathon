Data summarization, random variables, correlation, regression, probability, sampling, estimation, tests of significance, and two-sample comparisons are all topics that will be covered. The course does not require calculus and makes minimal use of formal mathematics.  However, basic review of mathematics may be helpful for clearer understanding of the topics.  The computer is used as a tool to enhance students' ability to analyze and interpret data collected.  All computer skills will be reinforced in class."
