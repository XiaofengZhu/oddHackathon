Besides his position as Senior Lecturer in the English Department, he works as a College Adviser in NU's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, and is a Series Editor for the University of Chicago's Chicago Visions + Revisions, a series of nonfiction books about Chicago.  He is a lifelong resident of Chicago's Rogers Park neighborhood, but thinks the South Side is under-rated.",

Students will also be well-versed in the differences between canonical \"Literature\" and popular fictions, different media, and how, as a culture, Americans think about crime and identity."
