We will cover the period of conception and prenatal development through the end of adolescence, looking at physical, perceptual, motor, cognitive, language, social, and emotional domains of development. We will look at what changes in development and how and why these changes are thought to occur. You will learn what it means to think developmentally about both children and adults. The course will cover normative development (what are the typical changes that occur for children) and individual differences (how do children differ from one another and why).  \n\nIn this course, you will learn to read and evaluate research on child development in professional journals and as presented in the media. We will also discuss the application of knowledge about development to areas of education, social policy, and working with children who have special needs. You will have the opportunity to observe and interact with young children during and outside of class."

The mid-term exam is worth 20%, and the final exams will account for the remaining 25% of your grade. Exam questions will consist of multiple choice, short answer, and essay questions. Materials from the text, assigned readings, and lectures will all be included. The lectures will not be fully redundant with the text, so expect questions that derive from material presented in class or from material in the readings that was not covered in class."
