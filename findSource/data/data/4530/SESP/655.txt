Students are highly recommended to purchase their own recorder, or to have more than one per group. Smart phone technology is sufficient for the tasks included in this course. There are also digital recorders specifically reserved for this class in the Student Services office. It is the responsibility of the student to ensure that they have chosen a device from which files can be exported. The teaching staff will not listen to interviews still on devices that do not have this capability."

Students who master the concepts and skills taught in this qualitative methods course will be better prepared to perform these tasks."
