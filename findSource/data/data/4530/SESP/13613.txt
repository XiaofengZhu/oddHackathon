The questions will reflect the readings, lectures and other materials covered recently, and will be distributed at the time. A third assignment will be an end-of-quarter take-home final exam.\n\nGrades will be determined as follows:\nActive participation in large and small group discussions:  20%\nCommunity Involvement or Exploration:  20%\nOne In-class Exam:  20% \nFinal Take-Home Exam:  40%"
