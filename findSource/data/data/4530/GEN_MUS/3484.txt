    "overview": "A Journey From First Rehearsal to Final Performance\nThis freshman seminar is designed for the general campus student. The course is designed to provide opportunities for music aficionados to experience music and music theater events from the inside-out. The only prerequisite for the course is a love of the performing arts! You do NOT have to read, perform, or understand music notation to succeed in this course. However, you have to be prepared to spend a lot of time attending rehearsals and concerts (minimally six hours a week), outside of the two required class sessions.\nInside and outside of classroom sessions, the instructor and invited guests will attempt to nurture a heightened awareness of the challenges that conductors, opera and music theater directors, and musicians/actors face when preparing for a performance. Through a series of observations, presentations, interviews, and interactive discussions/seminars, you will be better prepared to listen, observe, and critically analyze performing arts events on and off campus -- during this academic quarter, and hopefully for the rest of your life.\nAfter Week 1's introduction to the course and the music library, the Week 2 class sessions will concentrate on conducting lessons and video observations of concerts and rehearsals. In these initial sessions, you will learn many of the techniques needed to lead the world's greatest instrumental and choral ensembles (of course, with many additional years of practice).",
