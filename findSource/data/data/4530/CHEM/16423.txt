Additionally, one should be familiar with the following mathematics topics because they are used often in the general chemistry sequence: 1) simplifying algebraic expressions, 2) solving first-order equations, 3) manipulating exponents, 4) solving quadratic equations, 5) manipulating logarithms, and 6) linear regression using the model y = mx + b. (Some of these topics are covered in the appendices in the text book)."
