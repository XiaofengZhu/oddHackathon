            "desc": "Attendance in lectures and labs, participation in classroom exercises, performance on homework, quizzes, tests and special projects will all potentially contribute to developing Swahili language skills. These skills, especially literacy, are periodically assessed, and determine the final course grade. Graded tests and assignments during the course are intended primarily as means of discovering and correcting problem areas, i.e. a poor performance does not carve into stone a bad course grade, but rather leads to the diagnosis and correction of a problem. There is an ongoing assessment of oral proficiency skills in classroom and lab sessions, so absences which impair language acquisition in this skill area also represent missed opportunities to demonstrate assessable oral interactive skills, and consequently affect the final course grade. In addition to numerous but relatively brief assessed written exercises throughout the course, there will be two writing skills tests, one at mid-term and the other at the end of the term. Review classes are held during Reading Week. There is a 2-hour written final test and an on-line audio test during exam week, as well as projects that must be posted to Google Tools and on the course blog and wiki."
