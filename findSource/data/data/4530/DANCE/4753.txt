Students will be able to think critically about the lineage of western dance practices, using both scholarly research and performance documentation as evidence to support their own historical claims and personal artistic choices. This class will also prepare interested students for continued work with dance scores, either through the formal study of a notation system or the creative application of dance scoring methods and methodologies to future academic and professional work."
