        "bio": "Daniel Stolz works on the history of science in Islamic societies since the 18th century, with a focus on Egypt and the late Ottoman Empire.  His current book project is a history of astronomy in nineteenth-century Egypt.  The book weaves together the cultural history of new sites of astronomical knowledge, from state observatories to periodicals, with an examination of the continuity of Islamic traditions of astronomy.  Other projects underway include a history of reading science in the Quran, and an article on mechanical timekeeping in eighteenth-century Egypt.",
