            "desc": "In Spring 2010, the 224 \"Adapting Narrative\" course changed its structure to anticipate inclusion in a proposed undergraduate \"module\" in devising and adaptation. One change is the inclusion of first-year MFA students in the Theatre Directing Program, who work with groups of actors in the final performance for 224. The second change is an increased emphasis on audio-visual design, which utilizes the lighting and sound equipment in the AMS Krause Studio. Beginning in Winter 2014, the third major performance (employing a \"Jokerized\" narrator) has been eliminated, and will be replaced by workshops on designing QLab audio (which must be used for the second major performance composition)."

Typically a student collaborates in the adaptation, rehearsal, and performance of two major scenes (midterm and final). Two essays (in place of midterm and final exams) relate to problems in transforming the literary text into a performance text, and in performing narrators and narration. In addition, each student regularly posts informal written critiques of in-class performances to the course website. Attendance is mandatory. Outside-of-class rehearsal, negotiated by members of small groups, is mandatory.\n\nGRADING.\nOutcome-based rather than bell-curve based."
