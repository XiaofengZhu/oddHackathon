Exceptions to attendance will be for parent-teacher conferences or open houses. Please notify me of these events.\n\n2. Essay Reflections. Five essay/reflections must be sent to your supervisor and to me. Essay reflections are expected as listed in the syllabus. These should be responses to topics and questions. They may also include reflections on other aspects of your work and experiences. The essays will also give you an opportunity to communicate questions or concerns with your university supervisor. But more importantly, the essays encourage you to consider what you have done and/or are going to do in your experiences. Constant reflection of your work is a critical element of successful growth and development and indicates true professionalism.\n\n3. Video. All students are required to complete a video of one full period of teaching. \n\n**Although not required to receive the credit for student teaching, the completed digital portfolio of \"professional\" quality is also required before Illinois certification is possible (see digital portfolio website). The student teaching experience is a rich resource for the portfolio artifacts.\n\n4. How Candidates Know the Students Have Learned. See reflection #4 among Essay Reflection prompts."
