In my spare time, I write fiction and Dream about dancing The Argentine Tango.  (But rarely manage to get on the dance Floor.) I have 3 dogs  each more neurotic than the other. I dont think it is all my fault: they are rescues who were set in their ways when I got them. It is possible that I made them worse, however.",
