I work on the 20th century: I've written two books on economic ideas and economic policy in postwar Japan, edited five books that compare war remembrance in Japan, including the distinctive memories of Okinawans, to remembrance in the United States, Germany, and elsewhere, and am now working on a book about the different ways that people tried to create new institutions in postwar Japan that would prevent another disaster on the scale of their truly awful war.",
