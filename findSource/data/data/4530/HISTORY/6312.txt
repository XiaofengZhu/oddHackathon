What did this expansion mean for ordinary Americans? How did Americans negotiate their relationship with the federal government in the twentieth century? How did Americans make claims to citizenship and social and economic, as well as political, inclusion? Underlying all of these questions is the relationship between policy and public demand. In this class we examine a period marked by federal expansion and social movements, so we will, again and again, wrestle with the issue of who, exactly, determines national character and priorities."
