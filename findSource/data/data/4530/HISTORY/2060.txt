His first book, Until The Last Man Comes Home: POWs, MIAs, and the Unending Vietnam War (University of North Carolina Press, 2009) examined popular concern over captive and missing Americans during and after the Vietnam War to consider the war's legacies for US politics and foreign policy. His current book, The Confidence of Crisis: Confronting the Imperial Presidency, 1968-1992 explores the rise and fall of antiwar politics in the long 1970s.",
