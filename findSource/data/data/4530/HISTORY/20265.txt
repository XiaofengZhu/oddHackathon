        "bio": "I have been teaching about this period for a long time (since before taking a Yale PhD in 1975), from about every conceivable angle; it's been the focus of parts of my scholarship (for example, In the Shadow of War: The United States Since the 1930s (1995); and I lived through it.  My most recent book is Gay Artists in Modern American Culture: An Imagined Conspiracy (2007). In line with my career-long interest in cheerful matters, my current scholarly project is titled \"Go Directly to Jail: The Punitive Turn in American Life\"about the growth of mass incarceration and other punitive practices in the US since the 1960s.",
