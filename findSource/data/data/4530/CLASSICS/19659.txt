She is currently finishing her PhD in Classics from Yale University: her dissertation reconstructs the socio-cultural identity of colonists in the Roman province of Dacia (roughly modern-day Romania), from the perspective of their religious experiences. Fascinated with the myths of the Greeks and Romans from an early age, Graziela is interested in the many and sometimes unexpected ways in which the ancient world (its languages, myths, ideas, customs) still continues to impact our modern-day existence.",
