However, many of these students, housed in departments of English, French, German, History, Slavic literatures etc., have had no background in Jewish Studies.  The aim of the present course is to provide such students with an apprenticeship in modern Jewish cultural and literary history by means of close reading of and meditation upon, key Yiddish documents that illuminate the transformations of Jewish culture in Europe and the impact of these transformations in the shaping of European modernity."
