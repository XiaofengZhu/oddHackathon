Problem sets will be discussed in class and discussion sections.   The final is a term paper of 9 - 10 double-spaced pages.  It will allow students to relate key analytical themes of the course to a particular ethnographic case.   All the papers will provide students with an opportunity to think more systematically and rigorously about the social and cultural patterns and processes that are mediated and constituted by language usage.  The four short papers are each worth 10 points of the grade, and the final paper is worth 50 points.   Ten points of the grade is based on participation in discussion sections."

Segments of ethnographic films will also be used as case material for discussion in class.   Each class period will be a combination of lecture and \"practicum.\"   The practicum will allow us to work through together in class, as a \"research team,\" the ethnographic details and analysis of particular cases of semiosis in social life (i.e., the activity of using signs, verbal and nonverbal, in communication).  TA discussion sections are important for developing and clarifying concepts and themes introduced in lectures."
