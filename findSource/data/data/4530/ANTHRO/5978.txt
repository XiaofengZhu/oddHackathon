        "bio": "My research addresses key issues in the social sciences: state formation, urbanization, and the relationship between commoners and landscape.  It focuses on the Preclassic Maya community of Noh Kuh, located in modern-day Chiapas, Mexico, and is funded by a National Science Foundation Dissertation Improvement Grant and Wenner-Gren Foundation Dissertation Fieldwork Grant.  My research provides a critical intervention into elite-centered studies on the processes of incipient urbanism by turning to commoner households and focusing on the social and economic networks that are often invisible in elite-centered and top-down research.   Ultimately, I demonstrate how the economic and ideological practices of commoners were as important as the military and ideological activities of Maya elites to the rise of civilization.",
