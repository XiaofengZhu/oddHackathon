Due to the lack of any broad-based text covering these issues, as well as the paucity of introductory texts that specifically target educational technology, the instructor has compiled a set of papers that represent core topics, discussions, and trends in the field.\n\nYou are required to read the assigned readings prior to each class. While the course readings are sizable, they are manageable if you plan accordingly. The readings will be made available to you via the Blackboard website for the course."
