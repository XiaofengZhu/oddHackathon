            "desc": "The course is organized as a seminar. We expect each of you to come to class very well-prepared to take-up the discussion questions for each week, and be prepared to respond to objections from peers. To participate in this way, you will have to read the assigned texts carefully and critically before each class. We expect your comments to be referenced to the readings, and to use the readings thoughtfully and effectively. Voicing opinions without a basis in reference to the required readings or some other source is not very helpful. We expect you to bring copies of the readings to class, so you can reference them easily during discussions. Contributions to class discussions will count for 35% of the course grade and judged based on: \n\n1. Clear well-organized arguments, the use of evidence from the readings (or from other sources), and the ability to respond to the critique of peers.\n\n2. Two reaction papers (2-3 double-spaced, typed pages) where you react critically and thoughtfully to a particular reading or an issue (e.g., routines) that cuts across readings for a particular week, and/or draws in readings from prior weeks. There will be a sign up sheet for these papers available at our first meeting."
