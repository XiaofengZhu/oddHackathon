An important aspect of this course is the opportunity to learn from the exchange of participant ideas, opinions, experiences and interpretation of lecture information, presentations, and readings. As such, `discussion' reflecting reasoned thought, an understanding of the general principles of ethics, and an appreciation for the seriousness of ethics violations is expected and the quality of individual contributions will be weighed. By expressing your views and indicating why you hold those views, you will either become stronger in holding on to those views or you will see reasons for reconsideration. In either case, you will benefit from these discussions."
