The presenter is expected to use relevant literature outside of the chosen article(s) to provide a brief but comprehensive background of the subject matter. The presenter is also expected to relate the results of the article(s) under discussion with other relevant literature.\n\nGrades will be based on the how well the student places the topic in the context of the literature and the quality of the presentation. Grades will be assigned based on the evaluations of all instructors.\n\nSummary statements: Students will write summary statements (not exceeding 650 words) of each paper discussed during the quarter. These statements will be submitted electronically to all instructors. Grading of these statements will be based on accurate interpretation of the theoretical issues of the paper and critical examination of the methods and results."
