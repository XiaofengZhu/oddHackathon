(A2)</li>\n<li>Identify pharmacologic agents that cause hearing loss and vestibular disorders. Identify the audiological and vestibular profiles associated with this type of toxicity. (A8)</li>\n<li>Identify auditory and vestibular pathology based on information from audiological, vestibular and/or medical evaluation. Understand how individuals with these pathologies are audiologically and/or medically managed.
