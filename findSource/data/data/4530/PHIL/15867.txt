We will work through selections from some central texts in the Western tradition of political philosophy, culminating in a short paper. These meetings will serve to introduce students to the issues they will explore during the classes taught by Christoph Menke, one of the most prominent contemporary critical theorists. In these later weeks of the course, undergraduates will also participate in a short, presentation-based, weekly discussion group. Student evaluation will be based on the short paper, a short presentation, and a final research paper, the topic of which will be developed through individual consultation with the instructor."
