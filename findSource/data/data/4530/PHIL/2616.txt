The requisite exegetical, technical and analytic skills will be part of the learning accomplishment just as much as competence in the philosophy of language, epistemological fundamentals and the mastery of large amounts of complex textual sources in relatively short time.\nStudents will also acquire the ability to produce excellent analytically written and logically organized arguments in considering a complex conceptual framework delineating a very characteristic position."
