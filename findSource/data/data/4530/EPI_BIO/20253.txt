Use maximum likelihood method and methods of moments to estimate a parameter following a parametric model for practical data.\n2. Explain the concept of unbiasness, consistency, sufficiency, and efficiency.\n3. Apply the large sample properties of maximum likelihood estimator.\n4. Explain the concept of hypothesis testing, Neyman-Pearson Lemma, and the duality of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.\n5. Perform likelihood ratio, Wald, and score tests, and understand their differences.\n6. Appropriately use Fisher's exact and Chi-square tests for categorical data.\n7. Use some basic nonparametric methods in data analysis\n8. Conduct some basic Bayesian analysis."
