Formulate a research objective. \n2. Select the appropriate observational epidemiologic study design to address the objective. \n3. Define risk factor and outcome variables and how they will be measured. \n4. Describe the selection of subjects, including sampling methodology. \n5. Develop a statistical analysis plan that includes a description of the model building approach and strategies for assessing confounding and effect modification. \n6. Perform logistic, survival and Cox proportional hazards regression.\n7. Interpret results from logistic, survival and Cox proportional hazards regression models."
