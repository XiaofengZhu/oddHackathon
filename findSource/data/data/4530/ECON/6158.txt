Students will understand the measurement of price level changes, labor market variables, productivity, and the macroeconomic imbalances that can exist with the government budget and for assets and trade flows between nations in world markets.  Students will understand the monetary and financial systems and how they contributed to our current situation, both in the US and Europe.  Students will also understand the determinants of long run economic growth, and its implications."
