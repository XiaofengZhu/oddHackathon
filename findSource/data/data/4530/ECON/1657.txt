Lectures should be viewed as complements to, rather than as substitutes for the reading. The weekly discussion sections are an integral part of the course, and your attendance is expected. They will be used to expand on ideas presented in the text and in lectures, to discuss homework problems and as a time for you to ask questions about anything that you would like clarified. Problem assignments and due dates will be announced in class."
