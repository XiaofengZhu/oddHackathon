The problems will provide practice with the types of calculations and concepts that are important to a proper understanding of the course material. Some problems will provide valuable practice for the midterm and final, while other problems will require you to obtain and make use of real-world financial data or to analyze a case and thus will give you an idea of how theory connects to reality. Sample exams will also be provided to help students practice before the actual exam."
