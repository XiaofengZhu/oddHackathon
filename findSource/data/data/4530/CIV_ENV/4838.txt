On completion of the course, students should be able to:\n\n1)Calculate stress and strain distributions and maximum stresses and deformations arising from torsion, bending, shear loads, and general transverse loading;\n\n2)Calculate the principal stress state arising from various types of combined loading using Mohr's circle analysis;\n\n3)Understand the geometry, usefulness, and basic analysis of reinforced concrete and flanged rolled-steel beams;\n\n4)Perform basic engineering design by selecting the most economical beam geometry or composition for a given loading condition;\n\n5)Analyze real stress-strain tests performed in the laboratory and present results in an organized report."
