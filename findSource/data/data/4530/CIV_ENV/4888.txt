Examine factors involved in water demand and wastewater aggregate and differential yields in a community settings;\n\n2. Determine distribution of flows, safe yield  / capacity of retention facilities in water supply and distribution or stormwater control as part of water quantity management;\n\n3. Compute basic flow and pipe sizing for sewerage / stormwater example systems; using hydraulic and energy grade lines and calculate pumping and hydraulic constraints for pressure supply systems;\n\n4 Develop flowsheets for treating water and wastewater to meet physical, chemical and biological design parameters;\n\n5.  Using energy and mass conservation balances,  size heat and mass transfer devices in water and wastewater treatment; \n\n6. Utilize tracer curves and dispersion model to determine non ideal mixing effects;\n\n7. Compute doses of chemicals to reduce hardness, turbidity and microbials expressed in chemical, e.g. meq/l and practical lb / MG or lb / day units;\n\n8. Analyze the performance (including unit sizing) of common physical, chemical, and biological unit processes"
