Develop the basic mathematical tools for understanding models of population growth, sustainable harvest, extinction of fragmented populations, and spread of diseases. Explore the concept of the biological community and the role of biological diversity in healthy ecosystem functioning. Connect the scale of human population growth to its impact on the natural world, and the feedbacks on the human condition, in terms of health, economics, equality, aesthetics, and sustainability. Teach students how to apply mathematical-model-based problem-solving to major environmental issues at local and regional scales"
