There will be two group assignments during the course of the quarter: each group will be presenting for one assignment and providing peer assessment for the other. The second group project will involve a user proposal for submission to the Center for Nanoscale Materials at ANL. The final project topic is open for student groups to choose. For the final project, each group will both present and provide peer assessment. Both the presentation and peer assessment will be evaluated as part of the final grade."
