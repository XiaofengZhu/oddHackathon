In consultation with the instructor, you will pick a research question that can be addressed with an original or publicly-available dataset (consider your thesis or research!). During the course, you will conduct an analysis that answers your questions. You will develop a documented, reproducible analysis, and present results to the class. The instructor will facilitate all steps in this process and some homework assignments will be centered on your individual or group dataset."

Students will use R for all quantitative methods practiced in class and be confident in their ability to use R for their future statistical needs. Students will be able to access and interpret appropriate R-specific help resources freely available online.\n \n3. Students will be familiar with a variety of modern statistical approaches, methods, and techniques useful for analyses in ecology and conservation applications.\n \n4. Students will apply their knowledge of statistical methods and use their skills with R to conduct an analysis of their own dataset, they will develop a documented, reproducible analysis, and present results to class."
