These will ask you to read an article, analyze it and present it to the class for discussion. There will be two exams (short essay) - a mid-term and a second exam near the end of the course. In addition you will be asked to submit a 1 page reading response highlighting what you think are the key ideas and most interesting points of the week's readings, along with a question for class discussion purposes.  These will be collected as part of your participation grade."
