His dissertation, Not in My Gayborhood: Gay Neighborhoods and the Rise of the Vicarious Citizen, draws on gay neighborhoods to examine how actors make legitimate claims to ownership in a community without having any residential or material ties to that community. Theo has taught numerous classes in sociology, gender and sexuality studies on the undergraduate and graduate levels at Northwestern, including \"Sexuality and the City\" and a graduate-level seminar on undergraduate teaching.  His teaching has garnered numerous awards from Northwestern's Sociology department.",
