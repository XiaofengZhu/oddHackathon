A short review of grammar is given in class; however, the students must practice grammar patterns on their own with the textbook, the workbook, and dictionaries. Reading and writing skills are developed through various assignments. Reading materials in the textbook and TV dramas are used for developing skills to describe and summarize stories as well as for discussions on Japanese social and cultural aspects."
