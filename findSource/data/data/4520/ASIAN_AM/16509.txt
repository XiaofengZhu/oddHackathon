        "bio": "Professor Kim is a Charles Deering McCormick University Distinguished Lecturer in Asian American Studies at Northwestern University. Her research focuses on the histories and cultures of contact and migration between Asia and the Americas. She is currently finishing her first book Postcolonial Grief and the Afterlife of the Pacific Wars in the Americas which demonstrates how postcolonial grief and mourning around the Pacific Wars interrupts the formation and consolidation of the U.S. as an imperialist and white supremacist nation-state. The book argues that any struggle for future freedom, justice, and transformative politics in the U.S. has to come to terms with the history of U.S. military violence and colonialism in the Pacific Arena. She is also working on a second book which looks at the relationship between the Mexican Bracero Project and the Internment of Japanese Americans during WWII.",
