Most classes will have a follow-on homework set or an at-home lab project. There is no separate \"lab\" lab. Students must bring a Windows-capable notebook computer (Mac or PC) to class every day, with at least 90 minutes battery capacity. Note however that all circuits are real, not simulated. A $100 refundable equipment deposit may apply."
