Without thorough understanding of the stress imposed on the structure, and exact computation, these structures would never be possible. This course will familiarize students with the basic concepts of finite-element method for stress analysis, and computer implementation. The course will focus on topic specific programming and usage of commercial codes popular in the industry."
