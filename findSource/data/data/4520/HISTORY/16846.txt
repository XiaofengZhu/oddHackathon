We will look at primary sources, creative nonfiction, and historical texts. Students will practice analyzing primary sources of all types: letters, governmental documents, music, and photographs. Students will be expected to compose cogent historical arguments based on such sources, and bring them into conversation with historical interpretations. Finally, all students will practice leading a seminar-style discussion."
