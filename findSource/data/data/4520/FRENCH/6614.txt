Classes will include a variety of activities designed to help students acquire knowledge of basic French vocabulary and structures along with the ability to use what they have learned in situations of communication.  Classes will be conducted exclusively in French except when explanation of administrative information may necessitate the use of English.  Students are expected to study and practice regularly throughout the week (between classes), prepare for the next week's lesson, to participate actively in class activities, to speak only French in class, and to work independently with the En Avant! listening program and the En Avant! Internet activities.  Instructors will not teach grammar explicitly, instead we will practice grammar in communicative class activities.  Please note:  any elaborate grammatical explanations in English will be saved for instructors' office hours."
