Each session will be organized around subject areas to allow students the opportunity to try different blog formats. We will experiment with travel blogs, pop/culture/entertainment blogs, personal blogs, political blogs. The goal is to help students find their voices as writers and social critics.\n\nWe will share these expressions in class and work on honing our blog techniques, while also experimenting with multi-media and the incorporation of other news feeds to augment our commentary. \n\nGuest speakers - local blogging luminaries - will also be on hand to talk about their approaches to generating ideas and traffic. Each week a different guest will share his or her experiences creating on online following."

Since the blogs we create will be done in one of the free sites available to self-published bloggers (either WordPress or Blogspot), students needn't have any background in html coding either. What you will need is a wealth of ideas and opinions and a desire to share them with the world."
