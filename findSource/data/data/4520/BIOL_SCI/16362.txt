His research interests are in comparative primate musculoskeletal evolution, with emphases on the investigation of growth, function and evolution of the skull and postcranium in apes and humans.  Trained in biological anthropology at Harvard (B.A., 1975) and Duke (Ph.D., 1982) universities, he completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the American Museum of Natural History in New York prior to coming to Northwestern.  In addition to teaching medical and graduate Ph.D. students, he has regularly offered courses in the School of Continuing Studies and the university Summer School program.",
