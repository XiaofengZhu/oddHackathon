Be able to articulate these concepts using appropriate scientific terminology.\n-Understand the logic behind the gene theory, the chromosome theory and the theory of evolution, and be familiar with the experimental evidence on which these theories were first proposed.\n-Demonstrate the ability to apply the predictive power of genetics through problem solving, pedigree analysis, and statistical computation.\n-Understand how living species are connected through the process of descent with modification."
