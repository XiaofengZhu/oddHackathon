Provide students with an understanding of the structure, organization and operation of transportation systems and the political and social systems within which they operate. \n2.  Introduce students to principles and methods used for analysis and prediction of the performance and utilization of transportation systems and changes to them. \n3.  Provide students the opportunity to use these analysis and forecasting methods in realistic case studies to assess the impacts of physical, operational and pricing changes to transportation systems to support the decision making about investment, operations and pricing."
