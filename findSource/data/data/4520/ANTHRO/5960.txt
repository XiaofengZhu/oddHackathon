His specific research interests are in reproductive ecology, energetics, nutrition, and bio-cultural determinants of health.  His dissertation work was conducted among the Tsimane, an indigenous lowland Bolivian population transitioning from a hunting and gathering lifestyle to one more reliant upon the market.  Most recently he has been doing field work in Indonesia and has been working with colleagues from Duke University to set up a laboratory there.",
