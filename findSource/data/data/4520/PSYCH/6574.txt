My primary interests are decision-making and beliefs, psychology and law, human memory, forensic interviews with children, and the role of gesture in cognition and communication.  I enjoy teaching courses that generate intense discussions and force students to re-examine their own beliefs and behavior. \n\nAt Northwestern, I'm a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Psychology and I'm also the Faculty Master of the Ayers College of Commerce and Industry in the Residential College system.",
