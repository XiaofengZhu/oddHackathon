Ones that are too long will be returned without a grade. Class participation will account for 15% of the grade. Each student will be required to facilitate a discussion of a topic from one of the two books we will read in the class. Each student will also give a 10 minute presentation (15% of the grade) of a paper of their choice (but I recommend the last paper) that is within the context of the class."
