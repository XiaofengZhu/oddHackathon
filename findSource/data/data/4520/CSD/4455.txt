Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to cheating on an exam (e.g., copying others' answers, using a crib sheet) or plagiarism of a paper or exercise (e.g., taking material from readings without citation, copying another student's work). Failure to maintain academic integrity on an assignment will result in a loss of credit for that assignment, at a minimum.  \n\nIn compliance with equal access laws, the instructor is available to discuss appropriate academic accommodations that may be required by students with disabilities. Please make these requests during the first week of the quarter, except in unusual circumstances, so that arrangements can be made."
