Emphasis will be given to clinical teaching.\n\nTo become familiar with areas of learning that should be considered in a psychoeducational evaluation and to understand types of assessment that can be used for eligibility and intervention.\n\nTo become aware of relationships between various learning problems and clusters of disorders that co-occur.\n\nTo be able to generate hypotheses about the meaning of success and error patterns within each area of achievement.\n\nTo understand principles, procedures, and techniques for instruction and accommodations that may be needed for specific types of learning disabilities.\n\nTo understand the types of services and delivery systems used in schools.\n\nTo understand the need for various types of progress monitoring.\n\nTo understand possible long-term needs and outcomes, including risk and resilience."
