To view mathematics teaching as a dynamic activity that requires close attention to students' thinking (CF 1.1; IPTS #3, #7)\n2. To view learning as a process resulting from active engagement with the learning environment (CF 1.4; IPTS #4, #5)\n3. To view mathematics proficiency as requiring both procedural fluency and conceptual understanding (CF 1.4; IPTS #5)\n4. To enhance one's subject matter knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge in order to design and implement effective instruction (CF 1.2; IPTS #2)\n5. To be able to use the classroom a context for reflection and learning (CF 1.2; IPTS #7)\n6. To conduct oneself in a professional and ethical manner in working with students at a school site (CF 3.2; IPTS #9)"
