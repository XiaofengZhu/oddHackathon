Savage co-edited two editions of Algren's work (the 50th Anniversary Critical Edition of  The Man with the Golden Arm and the Annotated Edition of Chicago: City on the Make) and has published on Algren in scholarly and popular venues.  Besides his position as Senior Lecturer in the English Department, he works as a College Adviser in NU's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, and is a Series Editor for the University of Chicago's Chicago Visions + Revisions, a series of nonfiction books about Chicago.  He is a lifelong resident of Chicago's Rogers Park neighborhood, but thinks the South Side is under-rated.",
