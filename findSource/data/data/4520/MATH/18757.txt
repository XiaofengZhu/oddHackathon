        "bio": "Philip Egger is a fourth year Ph.D. student under Professor Paul Goerss at Northwestern University. A dual citizen of Switzerland and the United States, he graduated in 2010 with a M.Sc. in mathematics from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne (EPFL). Between graduation and beginning his doctoral studies, he spent a semester teaching middle school and high school mathematics at an American preparatory school in Beijing, China. He has worked the last two years as a teaching assistant for various undergraduate calculus courses at Northwestern, in addition to doing some private tutoring in his spare time.",
