Previously he was a Lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, where he received his Ph.D. in mathematics from in May 2011. His area of research is differential geometry, and in particular his work deals with geometric structures which arise in physics. Since 2005, Santiago has taught numerous undergraduate mathematics courses covering a wide variety of topics, and has won multiple teaching awards as a result.",
